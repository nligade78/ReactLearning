----------

Architecture Overview
The ABC Application is built on a modular and scalable architecture, utilizing modern web development practices. The architecture is designed to promote component reusability, maintainability, and efficient data handling. It is organized into several layers, each responsible for a specific set of functionalities.

1. Frontend Architecture
The application is built using React, a component-based library that allows for dynamic and efficient rendering of the user interface. The key aspects of the frontend architecture include:

Component-Based Structure: The application is broken down into small, reusable components, such as the SearchNetwork, Responsive App Bar, and DataGrid. Each component is self-contained, handling specific parts of the UI and logic.

State Management: Application state is managed using a combination of React Context and useState hooks. The Material UI Context is utilized to handle UI state, providing a consistent design and behavior across the application. This modular approach makes it easier to share state between components, improving scalability.

Material UI Integration: The UI components are built using Material UI, providing a responsive and modern design. Custom styling is applied where necessary to maintain consistency and branding.

Authentication and Authorization: The application uses an Auth Provider (e.g., Okta) to manage user authentication. Role-based access control ensures that different users have access to different parts of the application based on their roles and permissions.

2. API Layer
RESTful API Integration: The application interacts with external services via RESTful APIs, primarily for fetching and submitting data. The SearchNetwork feature is a critical part of this, as it involves querying data based on user inputs and displaying results in a DataGrid.

Network Handlers: A separate layer of networkHandlers is responsible for making API calls. This abstraction allows for centralized API logic, making it easier to manage error handling, retries, and token-based authentication. This layer also ensures that all API responses are processed and passed down to the relevant components.

Data Fetching and Display: The application fetches data asynchronously using React's useEffect and useState hooks. The data is then passed to the DataGrid component for efficient tabular representation. Any filtering or sorting logic is managed at the component level.

Authentication Flow and Role-Based Access Control
Auth Provider (Okta): User authentication is managed through Okta, using token-based authentication. When a user logs in, Okta issues a JWT token, which is then used to secure API requests and protect specific routes in the application. This token is validated on every request, ensuring secure communication.

Role-Based Access Control: The application enforces access control via Okta, restricting access to certain components (e.g., SearchNetwork, Configuration) based on user roles. Only users with the necessary permissions can interact with these components. Furthermore, based on the roles and access rights assigned to the logged-in user, different navigation options are displayed under the Profile Section in the application. Users will only see options for the pages they have access to, ensuring that restricted areas are not visible to unauthorized users.

Profile-Linked Navigation: After logging in, the user's profile section dynamically updates to reflect their access permissions. The options for accessing components such as SearchNetwork or Configuration appear under the profile dropdown or sidebar, depending on the UI design. If the user lacks the required permissions, those options will not be shown, maintaining a secure and streamlined interface.

Protected Routes: React Router manages application navigation, with specific routes protected based on the authentication and role state. If users attempt to access a restricted page directly (via URL), the system checks their permissions and redirects unauthorized users back to the login page or a 403 (Forbidden) page if necessary.

Session Management: User sessions are maintained through tokens stored in cookies or local storage. The system automatically logs out users when their session or token expires, prompting them to log in again to regain access.

4. User Interface Layer
Responsive Design: The application is fully responsive, adapting to various screen sizes, from mobile devices to large desktop monitors. Material UI's responsive grid system and custom breakpoints are used to ensure consistent design across different devices.

Responsive App Bar: The top-level navigation is handled by a Responsive App Bar, which adapts to screen size and user authentication state. It dynamically adjusts the navigation options based on the user’s role or permissions.

5. State and Context Management
Global State Management: The application uses React Context to manage global state across components, ensuring that authentication state, UI preferences, and other critical application data are available throughout the application.

Material UI Context: This context layer is used to control the UI theme, layout settings, and other Material UI-related configurations, ensuring consistent user experience.

Local State Management: In addition to global state, components manage their own local state using useState for controlling form inputs, table data, and dynamic UI behavior.

6. Data Presentation Layer
DataGrid: The DataGrid component from Material UI is used to efficiently display large amounts of data. It supports features like pagination, sorting, and filtering. The DataGrid is customizable to adapt to the application's needs, such as adding custom actions or column types.

Collapsible Sections: The UI features collapsible sections, allowing users to hide or reveal different parts of the form as needed. This improves the overall usability of the application, particularly for forms with multiple input fields or sections.

7. Error Handling and Validation
Form Validation: Forms in the application are validated both on the client-side and server-side. Client-side validation uses custom hooks to check for input errors before submission, while server-side validation ensures data integrity when interacting with APIs.

Error Feedback: User-friendly error messages are displayed when API requests fail, or form validation errors occur. These errors are logged for further investigation.
